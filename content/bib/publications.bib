  abstract={AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. By integrating saliency-guided regularization into behavior cloning, we improve policy robustness in CARLA simulation and real-robot (WidowX) experiments.},
  description={AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.},

  abstract={We introduce ORIC, a benchmark for evaluating object recognition capabilities of large vision-language models in incongruous contexts. The benchmark tests the robustness and generalization of VLMs when objects appear in unexpected or unusual settings.},
  description={Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at captioning, visual question answering, and robotics by combining vision and language, yet they often miss obvious objects or hallucinate nonexistent ones in atypical scenes. We examine these failures through the lens of uncertainty, focusing on contextual incongruity, where objects appear unexpectedly or fail to appear in expected contexts, and show that such cases increase recognition difficulty for state-of-the-art LVLMs. To study this regime, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context (ORIC) framework, which constructs incongruous object-context pairs through two complementary strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify hard-to-recognize objects present in the image and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to mine plausible but absent ones. Applied to MSCOCO, ORIC produces ORIC-Bench and ORIC-style training data. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and 2 open-vocabulary detectors reveals substantial performance drops and bias patterns under incongruous contexts. Fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct with Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning on 600 ORIC-style samples improves results on ORIC-Bench, AMBER, and HallusionBench. Overall, we show that contextual incongruity is a key source of uncertainty and provide tools for more reliable LVLMs.},

  abstract={We developed a friendly grid-connected distribution system integrating photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage systems (ESS) for remote rural residential applications. The system features real-time PV optimization and phase-imbalance-tolerant three-phase inverter control, providing reliable power supply for remote areas.},
  description={The study of this paper is to utilize distributed PV
and energy storage system (ESS) to both extend the capacity and
enhance the supply reliability of remote rural residential family
distribution system. The proposed new distribution system in this
paper has the highlights: The MPPTs of multi groups of PV
arrays in parallel in the system are simultaneously implemented
by only adjusting in real time the DC bus operation voltage, so
that the topology and control of the PV generation subsystem are
simplified and reduced on cost. The grid power injects under
controlling into the DC bus through the accessing circuit
composed of a six-phase diode rectifier with power frequency
isolation transformer and a boost circuit, which uses very mature
circuit and simple control to reach a higher reliability in a low cost way comparing with the scheme using three-phase fully controllable power electric switches rectifier. Using three single phase DC/AC inverters, each one with power frequency isolation
transformer, independent voltage amplitude control loop and
coordinated voltage phase control loop, builds the three-phase
DC/AC inverter, whose AC port is the type of Y0 wiring three phase four lines, and with the capacity of tolerating power
imbalances to a certain degree among phases. In this paper, the
topology, functional units, operation modes and their control
ways of the proposed distribution system are introduced in detail.
Also, the design method and case simulation results of the
proposed system are given.}
