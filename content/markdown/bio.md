Hi there! I am Litian Gong (龚利天), a Master's student in Electrical Engineering at [University of California - Riverside](https://www.ucr.edu/). I am currently a member of [TASL](https://tasl.ucr.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jiachen Li](https://jiachenli94.github.io/). I am also a student research intern at the [Learning and Interactive Robot Autonomy Lab](https://liralab.usc.edu/) at USC, working with [Prof. Erdem Bıyık](https://ebiyik.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my bachelor's degree at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://english.hust.edu.cn/) under the supervision of [Prof. Shaorong Wang](http://en.seee.hust.edu.cn/info/1057/1336.htm).

My research interest lies in robotic learning systems that fuse imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and VLMs to enable multimodal reasoning, long-horizon skills, sim-to-real transfer, and trustworthy, data-efficient autonomy.
