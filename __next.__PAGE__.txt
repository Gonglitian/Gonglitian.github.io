5:T42b,AutoFocus-IL is a simple yet effective method to improve data efficiency and generalization in visual imitation learning by guiding policies to attend to task-relevant features rather than distractors and spurious correlations. Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.6:T50c,Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel at captioning, visual question answering, and robotics by combining vision and language, yet they often miss obvious objects or hallucinate nonexistent ones in atypical scenes. We examine these failures through the lens of uncertainty, focusing on contextual incongruity, where objects appear unexpectedly or fail to appear in expected contexts, and show that such cases increase recognition difficulty for state-of-the-art LVLMs. To study this regime, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context (ORIC) framework, which constructs incongruous object-context pairs through two complementary strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling to identify hard-to-recognize objects present in the image and (2) CLIP-guided sampling to mine plausible but absent ones. Applied to MSCOCO, ORIC produces ORIC-Bench and ORIC-style training data. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and 2 open-vocabulary detectors reveals substantial performance drops and bias patterns under incongruous contexts. Fine-tuning Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct with Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning on 600 ORIC-style samples improves results on ORIC-Bench, AMBER, and HallusionBench. Overall, we show that contextual incongruity is a key source of uncertainty and provide tools for more reliable LVLMs.0:{"buildId":"eJmAS4bSgJUF5hZPCAqBJ","rsc":["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8 bg-background min-h-screen","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-12","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-1","children":["$","$L2",null,{"author":{"name":"Litian Gong","title":"Master's Student in EE","institution":"University of California, Riverside","avatar":"/bio.jpg"},"social":{"email":"lgong024@ucr.edu","location":"Riverside, CA, USA","location_url":"https://maps.google.com/?q=Riverside+CA","location_details":["University of California, Riverside","Riverside, CA, USA"],"google_scholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cirHYboAAAAJ","github":"https://github.com/gonglitian","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/Gonglitian/","orcid":"","twitter":"","youtube":"","instagram":"","facebook":"","researchgate":""},"features":{"enable_likes":true,"enable_one_page_mode":false},"researchInterests":["Scalable Robot Learning Frameworks","Imitation and Reinforcement Learning","Visual-Language Models for Decision Making","Sim-to-Real Transfer","Embodied AI"]}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"lg:col-span-2 space-y-8","children":[["$","section","about",{"id":"about","className":"scroll-mt-24 space-y-8","children":[[["$","$L3","about",{"content":"Hi there!
